## Introduction

In this project, we employ machine learning algorithms to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. The dataset used contains a mix of genuine and fraudulent transactions, and our objective is to build a model that can distinguish between the two.

## Data Description

The dataset used in this project is highly imbalanced, with a small percentage of fraudulent transactions. It includes the following features:

- **Time**: The time elapsed between this transaction and the first transaction in the dataset.
- **V1, V2, ..., V28**: The result of a PCA transformation.
- **Amount**: The transaction amount.
- **Class**: The response variable (1 for fraud, 0 for non-fraud).

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/credit-card-fraud-detection.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd credit-card-fraud-detection
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To run the project, use the following command:
```sh
The notebook includes the following steps:

Importing necessary libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, etc.).
Loading and exploring the dataset.
Handling missing values and data preprocessing.
Standardizing the 'Amount' feature and removing duplicates.
Addressing class imbalance using SMOTE.
Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
Training various models (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, etc.).
Evaluating model performance.
Saving the best-performing model using joblib.
Results
The project demonstrates the importance of data preprocessing and the effectiveness of machine learning in identifying fraudulent transactions. The best-performing model is saved and can be used for future predictions.

# Customer Churn Prediction

## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning techniques. The goal is to build a model that can accurately identify customers who are likely to leave, enabling businesses to take proactive measures to retain them.

## Introduction

Customer churn is a significant concern for businesses, as retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. This project leverages machine learning to predict customer churn, providing valuable insights for developing retention strategies.

## Data Description

The dataset used in this project includes various features that describe customer behavior and demographics. Typical features might include:

- **CustomerID**: Unique identifier for each customer.
- **Gender**: Gender of the customer.
- **Age**: Age of the customer.
- **Tenure**: Number of months the customer has been with the company.
- **Balance**: Account balance of the customer.
- **ProductsNumber**: Number of products the customer has purchased.
- **HasCrCard**: Whether the customer has a credit card (1 = Yes, 0 = No).
- **IsActiveMember**: Whether the customer is an active member (1 = Yes, 0 = No).
- **EstimatedSalary**: Estimated salary of the customer.
- **Exited**: Whether the customer has churned (1 = Yes, 0 = No).

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/customer-churn-prediction.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd customer-churn-prediction
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To run the project, use the following command:
```sh
The notebook includes detailed steps and explanations for the entire process, from data loading to model evaluation.

Modeling Process
Importing Libraries: Load essential libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn.
Data Exploration: Load and explore the dataset to understand its structure and identify any missing values.
Data Preprocessing:
Handle missing values.
Encode categorical variables.
Standardize numerical features.
Remove duplicate entries.
Data Splitting: Split the data into training and testing sets.
Model Training: Train multiple models, including Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Gradient Boosting.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Model Saving: Save the best-performing model using joblib for future predictions.
Results
The project demonstrates how machine learning can be used to predict customer churn effectively. The best-performing model, saved using joblib, provides accurate predictions that can be used to develop customer retention strategies.
